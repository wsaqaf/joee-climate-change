# Open data
Here you will find data used in a research study on the use of Twitter during 2008-2017 in relation to climate change and extreme weather patterns, namely heat waves, droughts and floods.

The study aims at answering the following three research questions:

RQ1: For the entire period 2008–2017, how do the three types of extreme events compare in terms of frequency of tweets and number of users?

RQ2: What spikes of activity were witnessed during 2008–2017 on Twitter mentioning climate change together with any of the three types of extreme events (drought, heat and floods)?

RQ3: For each year during 2008–2017, which type of extreme event (heat wave, drought, flood) generated the highest monthly peaks of activity and how can these peaks be explained?

The raw twitter data files provided contains all the data needed to come up with the answers to the research questions.
